rankall <- function(outcome, num = "best") {
    ## Read outcome data
    ## Check that state and outcome are valid
    ## For each state, find the hospital of the given rank
    ## Return a data frame with the hospital names and the (abbreviated) state name
    
    # The function should return a value for every state (some may be NA)
    # Handle ties in the same way as in rankhospital
    # Returns a data frame named hospital
    # 1st column: hospital name
    # 2nd column is named state
    # Hospitals that do not have data on a particular outcome should be excluded from the set of hospitals when deciding the rankings.
